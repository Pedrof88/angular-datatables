# FAQ
## Why version 2.0.0? Where is version 1.0.0?

Since AngularJS has released a version 2 that is breaking everything, I made a version 2 for simplicity purpose, to indicate the major version of this library is using the version 2 of AngularJS. 

## Why is there less functionnalities?

Because, I'm still working on it... But, if you want to contribute, feel free to make a pull request!

## Will you still work on version 0.X.Y?

Only on bugs, and only if I have the time (which I don't really have much nowadays...)

## Why no BowerJS? GruntJS?

Let's do all in NPM!

## Where is the Angular renderer? What about the Promise renderer?

Not yet!
